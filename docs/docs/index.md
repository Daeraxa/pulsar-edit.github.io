# Welcome to the Documentation for Pulsar

The developers and community around the Pulsar Editor would like to give you a
warm welcome to our Documentation home. Here you can find any information you
need from our [Getting Started](/docs/launch-manual/sections/getting-started) section to
sections on [Hacking the Core](/docs/launch-manual/sections/core-hacking) (the possibilities for utilizing the
functionality of Pulsar to it's fullest) to even our [API](#).
